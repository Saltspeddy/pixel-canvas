Pixel Canvas is project made with vanilla html, javascript and with the additional library tailwindcss, meant to create a simple pixelated canvas for drawing.
Using it should be fairly simple. Simply create a grid that satisfies your needs by entering the exact amount of rows and collumns that you want (this means that the user can create a grid made of rectangles and not only squares)
After that you will be able to color it with HEX color codes
