Pixel Canvas is project made with vanilla html, javascript and with the additional library tailwindcss, meant to create a simple pixelated canvas for drawing.
Using it should be fairly simple. Simply create a grid that satisfies your needs by entering the exact amount of rows and collumns that you want (this means that the user can create a grid made of rectangles and not only squares). The maximum grid dimension is 40 by 40 which is more than enough for a creative pixel drawing.
Selecting the colors can be done in two ways, you can either pick a custom hex color and put it in the input bar or you can select one from the custom color picker simply by clicking on it. In order to switch back to the color the custom color from your input, simply click the bar and it will autoselect it and you can return back to your art piece.
